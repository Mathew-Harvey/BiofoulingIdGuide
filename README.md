# Hull Biofouling ID Guide

A quick reference for commercial divers cleaning ship hulls in Western Australia. Helps you spot invasive marine pests and know when to report.

## What's In Here

1. **Interactive Handbook** (`index.html`) - Full guide with all species, photos, and ID tips
2. **Quick Reference Poster** (`A3Poster.html`) - Print this and stick it on the wall - 18 species at a glance

## What Changed in v2.0

- **Hull-focused species only** - Removed stuff you won't find on a hull (comb jellies, mud crabs, freshwater mussels)
- **Plain language** - No more scientific waffle, written in diver-speak
- **Three sections**:
  - Part 1: Invasive Hull Foulers (the bad stuff that sticks to hulls)
  - Part 2: Niche Hitchhikers (crabs hiding in sea chests)
  - Part 3: Native Fouling (the normal stuff you see every day)
- **Lookalike warnings** - Side-by-side comparisons so you don't confuse natives with invasives
- **Poster includes natives** - So you can see what's normal vs what's not

## Priority Levels

| Level | What to Do |
|-------|------------|
| **HIGH** 🔴 | Stop cleaning that area. Report NOW. |
| **MEDIUM** 🟠 | Report within 24 hours |
| **NATIVE** 🟢 | Normal WA fouling - no report needed |

## Found Something Dodgy?

1. **STOP** cleaning in that area
2. **PHOTO** it - close-up + wide shot, hand for scale
3. **NOTE** the location - bow distance, depth, port/starboard
4. **DON'T** scrape it off until you've reported
5. **SURFACE** and tell your supervisor
